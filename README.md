ImageLayout
===========

 A layout that arranges its children in relation to a background image. The layout of each  child is specified in image coordinates (pixels), and the conversion to screen coordinates   * is performed automatically.   * &lt;p>The background image is adjusted so that it fills the available space.  For some applications this might be a useful replacement for the now deprecated AbsoluteLayout.
