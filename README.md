ImageLayout
===========

A layout that arranges its children in relation to a background image. The layout of each  child is specified in image coordinates (pixels), and the conversion to screen coordinates is performed automatically.   

The background image is adjusted so that it fills the available space.  

For some applications this might be a useful replacement for the now deprecated AbsoluteLayout.
